# myfw
Framework That I am using to build my projects. It combines PHRoute and Jeffry Way sample framework from his PHP tutorials on laracasts.com.
I have made some little changes to combine 2 different sample frameworks in one. It is ready to work. You should only set up your database connection details in config.php file and add your project name in .htaccess file.
If you like it or use it please provide your feedback
